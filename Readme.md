## Simplified axios

a simplified version of axios, but with the main features.

to use just run node test.js. if you want to change something in the ts file it needs to be recompiled to js first.

recompile with `npx tsc test.ts` command. it will create the test.js and my-axios.js files.

then you can run using `node test.js`.
